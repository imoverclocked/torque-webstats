By default, the web interface will only show a months worth of job history. This
is because the history gets quite large for our web browsers to handle. You may
wish to modify the SQL queries to make this shorter or longer.

Searching for particular queries is easy. Simply type in a username/job name or
other identifying feature into the search box of the Job List tab. A similar
search is enabled for the User Statistics and Job Statistics tabs.

Explanation of tabs:

  Job List: the raw list of jobs (most recent job first) with basic info per job
  User Statistics: aggregate job resource usage by user
  Job Statistics: aggregate job resource usage by username and job name
