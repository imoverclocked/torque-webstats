Nodes and the web root need to be configured with the same secret key
(hint: look for SECRET_KEY) so that stats collection can work. By default
the secret is set to SECRET_KEY so things will work out of the box but
it's not recommended to keep things running this way in production.

Requirements:

  * PBS/Torque cluster
  * PHP webserver (mysqli extension)
  * MySQL DB

Note: The DB could pretty easily be ported to something else if MySQL
      finally drops off the face of the planet.

Step 1:
=======

Initialize your DB using the db/schema.mysqldump file. You should have a
username/password setup to access the DB you just created.

Step 2:
=======

Install the web_root files somewhere that can run php and connect to a
MySQL DB.
  - Make sure you change the SECRET_KEY in report.php to some random string.
  - Make sure you change HOSTNAME/USERNAME/PASSWORD/DB in db.php

Verify that you get no errors when you visit http://your.host.com/job_scheduler/job_list.php

Step 3:
=======

Install the compute-node/epilogue script to all of your compute nodes. Be sure to edit it
to reflect your environment. (secret/web_root need to be set)

Step 4:
=======

Send lots of praise in the form of patches/bug reports/feature requests to the author.
