PBS/Torque Statistics Collection and Reporting via the Web

This quick and dirty approach has been working reasonably well to collect and
report statistics on two different job schedulers since 2012. It's simple in
its design and doesn't aim to do anything complex yet. However, all of the data
that is collected could be used for more complex analysis at a later date.

This project would have been much harder if not for the awesome efforts of
jQuery and the DataTables plugin for jQuery:

 * jquery.com
 * datatables.net

If you want to donate money to someone for this project, give it to them.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.
